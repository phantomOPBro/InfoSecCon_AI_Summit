# Harnessing AI to Detect Sensitive Data Exfiltration


Welcome to the repository for the **Harnessing AI to Detect Sensitive Data Exfiltration** talk presented at InfoSecWorld 2024 in Orlando, FLorida. This repository contains a PowerPoint presentation and three key code files demonstrating the use of AI techniques to prevent data loss.

## Repository Contents

- **PowerPoint Slide:**  
  - `DLP_Presentation.pptx`: A PowerPoint file summarizing the key concepts, methodology, and use cases for AI in Data Loss Prevention (DLP). This slide deck is used during the talk to guide the audience through the practical applications of AI in securing sensitive information.

- **Code Files:**
  1. **Image CNN for DLP:**  
     - `image_cnn.py`: This file contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built to analyze image data and detect potential security threats. The model is designed to identify patterns in images that may indicate sensitive information leaks, such as screenshots or document captures.
   
  2. **Text-Based CNN for Log Analysis:**  
     - `text_cnn_logs.py`: This file includes a CNN designed for analyzing logs using character tokenization. It processes log data to detect anomalies or suspicious activities that could signify data exfiltration or tampering. This CNN model specifically uses a tokenization method tailored for character-level analysis of log files.
   
  3. **Generative AI Agent using Llama_Index:**  
     - `llama_index_agent.py`: This script uses the Llama_Index framework to create a generative AI agent capable of analyzing text-based data. The agent can generate contextual responses and insights related to data security and risk detection. Itâ€™s a key component for interactive log analysis and DLP response generation.

## Project Overview

This project showcases three distinct applications of AI in enhancing Data Loss Prevention capabilities:
1. **Image Analysis**: Utilizing CNNs to identify sensitive parts being sold on the deep/open web.
2. **Log Analysis**: Analyzing textual logs with CNNs to detect exfiltration of sensitive data.
3. **Generative AI for DLP**: Creating an AI-powered agent that helps automate responses and insights into potential data loss scenarios using the Llama_Index library.

## Setup and Usage
